# AllOrNothing
 
This Mod makes it so that when you draft a card, you pick all three or none of them in Monster Train.

# Installation

Install BepInEx by extracting the files to your game's root folder (the one with the executable). The BepInEx folder and the MonsterTrain_Data folder should be on the same level. Run the game, and BepInEx will generate a bunch of files in its own folder. 

Download the AllOrNothing.dll and place it inside the BepInEx/Plugins folder, Run the game, your mod should work.
